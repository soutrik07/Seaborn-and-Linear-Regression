# Seaborn-and-Linear-Regression

Here, I'm going to be looking at movie budget and revenue data. This dataset is perfect for trying out some new tools like scikit-learn to run a linear regression and seaborn, a popular data visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib. 
The question we want to answer today is: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more? 

I learnt the following:

How to use a popular data visualisation library called Seaborn?

How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn?

How to plot a regression a scatter plot to visualise relationships in the data?

How to add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart?
